## Overview: What Is Jekyll?
Jekyll is a static site generator.
That’s just a fancy way of saying that it takes a bunch of HTML, Markdown, CSS, and JavaScript source files, combines them as needed based on layout files that you’ve specified, processes any template code that you’ve written, and spits out a build directory (e.g., _site/) that basically houses all of your website’s content, ready for hosting on a web server (like GitHub Pages!).

In plain English, Jekyll makes it easy for you to create a website—and, more commonly, a blog—with plain old HTML and Markdown, without having to worry about things like how to add tags to posts or make certain static data accessible on all of your pages. It takes care of these things for you so you can focus on doing what you love the most: writing (or, in my case, writing and dev)!
