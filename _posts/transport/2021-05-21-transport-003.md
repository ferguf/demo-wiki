| Notification Type: | Hardware Update |
| Notification Target groups: | Metro Engineering |
| Prepared: | James Bachtel |


| Notification Number: | TUN-Metro-2029 |
| Notification Name: | New 100GE QSFP28 Optics for Metro 3.0 |
| Status: | Active |


This **Technology Update Notification** (TUN) is being published to inform you of changes or additions to Lumen Technology's network architecture, hardware, software or device configuration. This TUN is a dated document and reflects changes to the architecture, hardware, software, or device configuration at this moment in time. As such, subsequent policy updates may be issued at a later date that could override this document.

# Purpose
This **Technology Update Notification** advises the respective groups of the proposed changes to the currently approved configurations in **Lumen's** network. A **TUN** is accompanied by WIKI documents that have been updated with information about new deployment standards and general configuration templates. A **TUN** announces that the architecture design work has been completed, with new architectures documented and approved by the architecture team. This **TUN** can be used as a notification to other teams and a handoff for further development.
