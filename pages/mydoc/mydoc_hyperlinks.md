When linking to internal pages, you can manually link to the pages like this:

you can also download the file
[Powerpoint](/downloads/powerpoint/Colorless Metro overview .pptx) or a [PFT](/downloads/powerpoint/Colorless Metro overview .pdf)

* Store the file in the downloads directory or in a subdirectory (/powerpoint)  

```
[Powerpoint](/downloads/powerpoint/Colorless Metro overview .pptx)
[PDF](/downloads/pdf/Colorless Metro overview .pdf)
```

If you change the file name, you'll have to update all of your links.
